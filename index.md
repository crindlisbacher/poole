# Emma Rindlisbacher's Marvelous World

Hi! I'm a reporter and occasional researcher who writes about finance, labor, and education. My reporting has exposed congressional conflicts of interest and gotten students out of predatory debt. I love stories that have interesting legal or financial documents, as well as stories that involve public records. Please reach out if there's something I should be writing about: I protect the anonymity of my sources.

I also occasionally blog about finance at The Bagholder Report. Check out my [article on Harley Marine](https://bagholderreport.substack.com/p/whos-left-holding-the-whole-business): it’s a fun read and explains some of the basics of how securitization works.
